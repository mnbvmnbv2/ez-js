## Setup

### Create HTML file

In VSCode, you can just write `!` and it will autofill the setup for a html file.

If you don't use VSCode or it does not work, you can copy this:

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
    </html>

### Create javascript file

You can create a javascript file in many ways. You can for example create any type of file in your folder/working directory and end it with .js. This can easily be done in VSCode where you can clearly see the file extention (what the file ends with after .).

## Commenting

For commenting on a single line:

`//`

Example:

    // hello

For commenting on multiple lines:

Start with:

`\*`

End with:

`*/`

Example:

    /* asf
    hello
    world
    */
